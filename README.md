# static_site_generator_haskell

One day it will be a static blog generator. Today is not that day.

[Read the book](https://learn-haskell.blog).

Concepts new to me: EDSL (Embedded Domain Specific Language)

This book is not great for complete beginners to Haskell with some programming knowledge. It begins easily enough, but ramps up the difficulty pretty fast. In the later chapters especially, it is unclear what is supposed to be an explanation and what is supposed to be implemented.
